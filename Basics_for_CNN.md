Some basic knowledge of CNN as well as GANs that helped me understand.  

## [Epoch vs Batch Size vs Iterations](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/epoch-vs-iterations-vs-batch-size-4dfb9c7ce9c9)  
> Epoch: One epoch is when an ENTIRE dataset is passed forward and backward through the nn only once.  
> Batch Size: patches of dataset  
> Iteration: number of patches for one epoch
